Paper Replication for **Composed Image Retrieval using Contrastive Learning and Task-oriented CLIP-based Features**. <br/>
Paper Link - https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11485

### Start with cloning th emain repository
git clone https://github.com/ABaldrati/CLIP4Cir

### Install the following dependencies
`pip install comet-ml` <br/>
`pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git`

### Downloading the fashionIQ dataset
Use below drive link to download the fashionIQ dataset. <br/>

### Preprocessing
Use the `resize_images.py` script to resize the images as per the paper requirements. <br/>
For RN50 we need `224 x 224` and for RN50 we neeed `288 x 288`. 
We can do this by the following command
`python resize_images.py  --image_dir IMAGE_DIR --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR --image_size IMAGE_SIZE`

We also need to copy the pretrained weights in the CLIP4Cir irectory.
The parent directory has to follow the following structure in order for the scripts to work.

### Training and Validation
For this just follow the uploaded file Paper_Implementation.ipynb. Just make sure to place this file in the CLIP4Cir directory or set the same as the current work directory.
